# Predicting_the_status_of_product_in_Amazon_using_LogisticRegression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the status of e-commerce orders, specifically whether an order has been canceled or delivered. It leverages machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, to make these predictions. The project showcases the entire data preprocessing pipeline, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling. It also demonstrates how to evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, named "Amazon_Sale_Report.csv," contains information about e-commerce orders. It includes various features such as sales channel, category, size, quantity, currency, and the order's status (canceled or delivered). The goal is to build a classification model that can predict the order status based on these features.

## Results
The logistic regression model successfully predicts the order status based on the provided features. It achieves a high accuracy of 100%, indicating strong predictive performance. The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's true positive and true negative predictions.
